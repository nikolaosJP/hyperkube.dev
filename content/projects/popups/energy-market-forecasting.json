  "modalDescription": "Forecasts day-ahead prices with STL imputation, cyclical encoding, renewable share, demand spreads, and 24h, 48h, 168h lags, then feeds an Optuna-tuned XGBoost optimized on trading PnL. Adds conviction-based sizing, walk-forward backtests with slippage, and a simulated €1.38M PnL so renewables doing something weird becomes a trade ticket.",
