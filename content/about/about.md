## Intro
Welcome to my little corner of the universe, where I poke at market microstructures, evolutionary algorithms, and autonomous agents like a raccoon investigating a shiny object. There are no ads, no tracking, and no [<u>AI slop</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_slop). Just me, my code, and whatever strange ideas spill out of my head.

Every drawing you see here was hand-drawn by me. I am not an artist. At all. Some of these drawings may in fact be crimes. But they get the point across, and that’s what matters… probably.

## The Human Behind the Terminal
I am a Tokyo-based Research Scientist. I pivoted from a PhD in Sustainability Science to high-frequency trading, swapping energy grid optimization for market microstructure analysis. These days, I am building algorithms that operate so fast they technically live in the future. They analyze microstructure, decide what to trade, and quietly judge human reaction times.

When I'm not designing algorithms, I am:
- Playing video games, currently working my way through KCD2.
- Cranking out custom DND VTT tokens via a fine-tuned an SDXL LoRA.
- Playing chess with my pretentious 1500 ELO, mixing supposed tactics with confidently delivered blunders.
- Surfing, skydiving, and scuba diving whenever I get the urge to let nature toss me around from three entirely different directions.
