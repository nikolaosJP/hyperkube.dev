**Full article title:** *A tale of two (Florida) cities: perceptions of flooding risk and adaptation in Tampa’s Hyde Park and Saint Augustine*  

*Because nothing reveals a community’s personality quite like water quietly trying to move into it.*

## The Setup  
This study compares two coastal neighborhoods that technically share the same climate but emotionally live on different planets.  
- **Hyde Park (Tampa):** Flooding is mostly hypothetical, like worrying about a shark attack while standing in a kiddie pool.  
- **Saint Augustine:** Flooding happens often enough that residents treat it like an irritating seasonal guest.

To test how future conditions shape preferences, residents were split into two groups. One saw a gentle, manageable future water level. The other saw a four foot scenario that basically suggests investing in stilts. The results were predictable in the best way. Bigger water meant bigger demands for action.

## What Residents Actually Think  
The two communities rated the same problem very differently.  
- **Saint Augustine residents** already see water sneaking into their streets multiple times a year. As a result, they take the issue seriously, know what their city is doing, and want strong interventions.  
- **Hyde Park residents** are less informed about municipal plans, less concerned overall, and more skeptical of federal involvement. Flooding is something that happens “elsewhere,” preferably “not here.”

In short: reality shapes perception, and frequency shapes urgency.

## How Choices Change with Scenario  
The experimental twist worked beautifully.  
- Mild scenario: people picked a modest set of adaptation measures.  
- Four foot scenario: suddenly everyone becomes an amateur urban planner with an appetite for sea walls.

Humans are very consistent in not wanting their living rooms to become wading pools.

## Key Insights  
• Awareness varies wildly between neighborhoods and is heavily influenced by lived experience.  
• Higher projected risk increases willingness to support more interventions.  
• Residents in frequently flooded areas want government involvement, and lots of it.  
• Residents in less affected areas prefer a lighter touch from above.  
• Adaptation planning fails when it assumes everyone shares the same baseline understanding of risk.

## Moving Forward  
If Florida wants coherent adaptation strategies, it must accept that neighborhoods interpret risk through entirely different emotional channels. Some residents need reminders, some need reassurance, and some just need you to acknowledge that their street floods so often it should probably have a tide chart.

The study’s conclusion is simple and quietly profound:  
you cannot design adaptation pathways without first understanding the psychological landscape.  
Engineering solves the water problem.  
Understanding people solves everything else.
