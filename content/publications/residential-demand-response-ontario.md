**Full article title:** *Expert Assessment of Prioritized Determinants for a Smarter Grid Through the Lens of Residential Demand Response: The Case Study of Ontario, Canada*  

*Because everyone asks for expert assessments, but no one enjoys it when the experts conclude that the real problem is… the people asking for the assessment.*

## What This Paper Actually Contributes  
Instead of surveying consumers about DR (“Sure, I guess I’d participate,” said no one ever when the peak event actually arrived), this study flips the binoculars around and interrogates **experts**. Using the **Grounded Delphi Method**, the authors extract, refine, and force consensus on the true determinants shaping residential demand response in Ontario. Think of it as a structured intervention where experts gently explain, “Your programs aren’t failing because consumers are irrational, they’re failing because the system is.”

The contribution: a ranked, expert-validated map of what must be fixed first if DR is ever going to be more than a polite suggestion on utility websites.

## Key Insights 
Ontario’s early DR rollout suffered from demand forecasts that aged poorly and smart meters that occasionally behaved like they were auditioning for a fire-safety video. That shaky technical foundation made both the public and utilities extremely unexcited about DR.

Experts also agreed: consumers don’t understand DR because nobody has explained it properly. As long as DR feels like a cryptic side quest in an already confusing electricity system, adoption will remain microscopic. And even consumers who *do* understand it shrug when offered tiny incentives, meaning that Ontario’s current price signals are about as motivational as discovering a nickel in your dryer.

A major theme: the “average consumer” does not exist. DR was designed as if every household shares identical comfort thresholds, schedules, technology attitudes, and thermostat philosophies. In reality, households behave less like a unified population and more like a zoo of wildly different species. Without segmentation, DR programs end up pleasing no one.

Then there’s winter, Ontario’s true final boss. Residential peak load is driven by natural-gas heating, not electricity. That means classic electric DR can do little during the time of year when flexibility is most needed. Experts point toward **integrated gas–electric DR**, which is powerful but ethically delicate (no one wants a utility quietly adjusting their heat at –30°C).

Finally, privacy concerns loom large. Experts stressed that unless DR comes wrapped in ironclad data protection, households will continue assuming that DR is just a polite synonym for “your utility starts monitoring your appliances like a nosy relative.”

## Moving Forward  
The expert-ranked priorities are clear:  
design meaningful incentives, simplify programs so they can be explained without diagrams, safeguard customer data like it’s a rare artifact, segment households instead of pretending they’re all one person, modernize regulation so innovation doesn’t suffocate in administrative molasses, and expand DR to span both electricity and gas so winter stops laughing at the grid.

Ontario doesn’t need more DR pilots.  
It needs DR programs designed for actual humans, running in an actual energy system, during actual Canadian winters, which is precisely what this paper finally maps out.
